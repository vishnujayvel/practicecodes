create a 5x2 (rows x columns)

answers 

for ans1.png = scorch
    ans2.png = fillet
    ans3.png = 633282941
    ans4.png = cakeordeath

main answer = churchofillumination

once user types correct answer for the clueX.png (where X = 1,2,3,4) then the pic should change
to ansX.png(where X = 1,2,3,4 correspondingly).

once user types churchofillumination in the main answerbox, goto next level.

the order of the pics and the answer boxes is like this:

		col1		col2
	row1	clue1.png 	clue2.png

	row2	answerbox	answerbox
	
	row3	clue3.png	clue4.png

	row4	answerbox	answerbox

	row5 - 		mainanswerbox



p.s can u make it look like the mainanswerbox is not visible until all the 4 ansX.pngs (x = 1,2,3,4) are visible.
